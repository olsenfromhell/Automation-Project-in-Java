## Automation Project in Java

This project is dedicated to practicing writing UI and API tests using the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and Page Object model.
The technologies and frameworks used in this project include:

- Selenide: for browser automation and UI testing.
- Rest Assured: for API testing.
- JUnit 5: for writing and running tests.
- Jenkins w/ Allure Reports: for CI/CD and generating test reports.
- Java Collections Framework: for handling data structures.
- Stream API: for processing collections of objects.
- DataFaker: for generating data in tests.
- Gradle: for project build and dependency management.

The project is in development and I update it from time to time.

All tests are run with ```./gradlew test```
