# Automation Project in Java

Welcome to my automation project!

This project is dedicated to practicing writing UI and API tests using the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and Page Object model.
The following technologies and frameworks are utilized in this project:

- Selenide: For browser automation and UI testing.
- Rest Assured: For API testing.
- JUnit 5: For writing and running tests.
- Allure Reports: For generating test reports.
- DataFaker: For generating fake data in tests.
- Java Collections Framework: For handling data structures.
- Stream API: For processing collections of objects.
- Gradle: For project build and dependency management.

The project is in development and I update it from time to time.
